# EDA-Games
My solutions to every EDA Game I have solved. Solutions might be better or worse depending on the free time i get that year, but all of them should at least beat the Dummy. Solutions to each year's Game will only be published after the Game has ended.

You can use any solution to get ideas or templates on how to solve the game, but bear in mind all EDA solutions are checked for plagiarism, so copy at your own risk.
